# Client interview related to the Data Pura Vida Project

This markdown file serves as a centralized record of questions directed to the Product Owner of the Data Pura Vida software project. Its main purpose is to document both the inquiries and their corresponding responses to ensure clear communication, facilitate decision-making, and provide a reliable reference throughout the development process. By maintaining this log, the development team can track clarifications, avoid repeated questions, and align more effectively with the project's goals and requirements.

## List of questions

1. How do you specifically envision the monetization of the data (subscriptions, pay-per-query, licenses, donations, etc.)?

2. Besides the data users may upload to the platform, should there be a predetermined data access agreement with national public institutions to contribute data?

3. What are the expectations regarding ongoing support and updates once the platform is live?

4. Is there a specific investment range or allocated resources that we should keep in mind when planning the project phases?

5. Do you have any specific types of data in mind that you consider a priority to share through the platform?

6. Do you already know of similar systems in Costa Rica or other countries that serve as a reference or inspiration?

7. How important is it to you that the platform be easy to use for non-technical people?

8. What devices should be able to access the platform? Is it important that it works on mobile phones?

9. What types of data do you consider particularly sensitive and that would require additional protection measures?

10. How do you envision the platform's growth over the next 3-5 years? What scalability should we consider?

11. Are there any integrations with existing government or private systems that are a priority?

12. How would you measure the success of this platform? What indicators would be most important to you?

13. Are there any specific features or functionality that you consider essential and should not be missing?
    
14. Should every user (individuals, companies, government agencies) verify their identity with official documents (e.g., ID, tax records) to register, or should some users have simpler access (e.g., anonymous public data browsing)?

15. Should private companies be allowed to sell their data on the platform, or should it only host free/public-sector data? If paid, how should revenue be shared

16. Should access to the platform be limited to users in Costa Rica, or should it be open globally?

17. Will users need training to navigate the platform? Should there be in-app guides, a helpline, or dedicated support teams for government/business users?

18. How long should the internal user validation process after registration take? Should it be instant (via AI) or include a period for manual review by an authorized team?

19. Should the registration form change automatically based on the user type (e.g., showing different fields for individuals vs. companies), or should it stay simple and collect additional details later?

20. Should the system apply different validation rules depending on the user type? For example, should companies provide tax documents while individuals only need an ID? Or should all users follow the same basic checks?"

21. What information should the approval email include? For example: just a confirmation, login instructions, or a summary of the data submitted during registration?

How do you specifically envision data monetization (subscriptions, pay-per-query, licenses, donations, etc.)?
- Data requires space, and space eventually comes at a cost, so it can't be completely free. There must be a maximum free upload size; above that, you have to pay for the space. Then, when someone offers paid data, the platform must add a fee to the price they're asking, as it's the platform's responsibility to process the payment and the data. When data is shared on a paid basis, the user defines whether it's by size, by time, by both, or completely open upon payment. We add the fee based on that same scheme. Commissions are charged based on these combinations.

Besides, data users may upload to the platform. Should there be a predetermined data access agreement with national public institutions to contribute data?
- It's possible, but always under the paid-for-size scheme.

What are the expectations regarding ongoing support and updates once the platform is live?
- The platform requires 24/7 automated monitoring, and there will always be a development team providing maintenance, support, and improvements over time.

Is there a specific investment range or allocated resources that we should keep in mind when planning the project phases?
- No, the project will be funded by the government.

Do you have any specific types of data in mind that you consider a priority to share through the platform?
- No, but having an official data source that identifies citizens is important and a pillar.

Do you already know of similar systems in Costa Rica or other countries that serve as a reference or inspiration?
- No, but there is a Cardano project that can be a reference called Prism. https://www.learningcardano.com/atala-prism/

How important is it to you that the platform be easy to use for non-technical people?
- All users will be citizens, so they are non-technical, but they do know how to collect data and analyze it, i.e., they at least know Excel.

What devices should be able to access the platform? Is it important that it works on mobile phones?
- Yes, mobile and desktop via the web.

What types of data do you consider particularly sensitive and that would require additional protection measures?
- All information will always be protected, however, when someone shares information, they decide whether to encrypt certain fields.

How do you envision the platform's growth over the next 3-5 years? What scalability should we consider?
- I would expect to have 40 users in the first year, a maximum of 100 during the following two years, and up to 200 by the end of year 5. These are highly specialized users.

Are there any integrations with existing government or private systems that are a priority?
- It may be necessary to connect to APIs from various entities depending on the automations that are achieved.
How would you measure the success of this platform? What indicators would be most important to you?
The main thing will be the number of monthly queries to the platform.

Are there any specific features or functionality that you consider essential and should not be missing?
- Security is paramount, and the second thing is that the data model maintains itself.

Should every user (individuals, companies, government agencies) verify their identity with official documents (e.g., ID, tax records) to register, or should some users have simpler access (e.g., anonymous public data browsing)?
- If it is part of the requirements.

Should private companies be allowed to sell their data on the platform, or should it only host free/public-sector data? If paid, how should revenue be shared
- Totally all, public and private.

Should access to the platform be limited to users in Costa Rica, or should it be open globally?
- Currently only CR but eventually it is valid to sell this service to other countries.

Will users need training to navigate the platform? Should there be in-app guides, a helpline, or dedicated support teams for government/business users?
Help and assistant, but it shouldn't be so necessary.

How long should the internal user validation process after registration take? Should it be instant (via AI) or include a period for manual review by an authorized team?
- It should not be limited because all validations are unique.
Should the registration form change automatically
